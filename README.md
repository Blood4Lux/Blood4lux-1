PROJECT JUSTIFICATION:
     Blood bank management has become a very big problem in many parts of the world especially for people in remote areas. Sometimes, it takes  long time for a person to locate someone who has the required blood group he/she is looking for and, in most cases, people die of not getting their blood group on time. Hence the need for this application, to help needy users to contact donors who have the required blood group.
     
GOAL:
     The goal of this project is to have an android mobile application which can connect  blood Donors with the blood Recipients. And also make it possible for a user to search for a donor. The user will be first asked to register. The data will be stored in database which will act like an Admin by checking validity of both donor and requestor. User module will have three options to BECOME DONOR, MAKE REQUEST or SEARCH. 
     
      BECOME DONOR
			This part will have name, blood group, location and telephone number  (which will be verified in backend) of the person who wants to become a donor. These information will be made public for needy users to contact them.
			

	MAKE REQUEST:
			A USER can make a request by entering his/her name, blood group, location and telephone number (which will be verified) and also an optional message.This information will be made public for donors or other users to contact them.
     Both Request and Donor details can be shared to any other application like WhatsApp groups, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram through a share button.
     
     SEARCH:
		         There will  be a “Search” interface where an user can search for a particular blood group donors in the location of their choice even without making a common request message.
